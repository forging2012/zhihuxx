		－－－－－－同志们别光点感谢啊！还有个小小的赞可以点啊！<br><br>题主你快看我！<br>我真的去google了一下胸部大小和基因的关系！<br>已经有实验证明基因的确影响的胸部大小，而且那个研究也表明了胸部的大小也和乳腺癌有关系。<br><br>题主啊我不是这个专业的，我开头看了下，下面的我真的是翻译无能啊啊啊啊啊啊对不起啊啊啊啊啊啊<br><br>另外为什么会这么严肃的答这道题呢。<br>因为要是题主真的没有骗照，真的想知道这个问题的答案呢？<br>各位一上来就说骗照的人是平常就觉得知乎发这种问题就应该是骗照的吗？太恶意了吧。<br>真是小姑娘，看到这样得多伤心啊。<br><br>如果真的是骗照的。<br>我只能表示谢谢你又让我学习到了一个知识点。<br><blockquote>Breast Size Matters — But Not In The Way You Think<br>July 3, 2012<br><p>Published by <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//blog.23andme.com/author/shwu/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Shwu<i class="icon-external"></i></a> under <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//blog.23andme.com/category/23andme-research/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">23andMe Research<i class="icon-external"></i></a>, <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//blog.23andme.com/category/health-traits/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Health and Traits<i class="icon-external"></i></a></p><br><p><em>With Nick Eriksson</em></p><br>Social norms and preferences aside, it turns out that breast size matters — but not quite in the way you think.<p><a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/13/53/abstract" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">23andMe’s latest research paper<i class="icon-external"></i></a>, published in the journal <em>BMC Medical Genetics</em>, shows that genetic factors influence whether women have double As or double Ds. This might sound a bit frivolous at first but our research uncovered surprising connections between the genetics of breast size and the genetics of breast cancer.<br></p><p>Analyzing data from more than 16,000 women of European ancestry, we compared their answers to survey questions with their genetic data at millions of SNPs. We found a total of seven genetic factors significantly associated with breast size, three of which are strongly correlated with SNPs already linked to breast cancer.</p><p><strong>How do you study breast size anyway?</strong><br>In our case, no one’s personal space was violated — all of our data was self-reported by female 23andMe customers of European descent who have opted into research and filled out an online survey. We specifically asked about bra cup size as an approximation for breast size using a 10-point scale ranging from “Smaller than AAA” to “Larger than DDD”. We also took into account age, breast-related surgeries (augmentation, reduction, or mastectomy), pregnancy and breastfeeding status, and bra band size (which is correlated with body mass index (BMI)).</p><p>Most of the genetic factors we identified for breast size lie in regions of great importance for breast cancer. One of the SNPs, rs12173570, is known to regulate the expression of the estrogen receptor gene, which plays a vital role in breast growth and in the majority of breast cancer cases (known as “ER+” or “hormone positive” types).</p><p>Another one of these SNPs, rs7816345, is located in a region of the genome (8p21) that often shows abnormalities in people with a certain subtype of breast cancer. Scientists also recently reported <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076615/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">genetic factors influencing breast density<i class="icon-external"></i></a> — a <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa062790" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">risk factor<i class="icon-external"></i></a> for breast cancer — and our research suggests that one of those factors may also be associated with breast size.</p><p>These findings show that some of the same biological pathways underlie both normal breast growth and breast cancer. This isn’t a huge surprise if you think of cancer as unrestrained growth. But the relationship between breast size and breast cancer is complicated. <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10231159" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Some<i class="icon-external"></i></a><a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16284954" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">studies<i class="icon-external"></i></a> have found that larger breast size as a young woman is associated with a slight increase in breast cancer risk, but only in women who were lean at a young age. The genetic factors we found aren’t enough to explain this association, but support the idea that breast size and breast cancer are related.</p><p>While the topic of breast size raised a few eyebrows when we first put out the survey (some thought it was too personal, or couldn’t be serious science), this paper demonstrates that important scientific insights can come from the most unlikely of places. Although the connections between these genetic factors, breast size, and breast cancer aren’t fully understood, our findings give clues to the function of some of these genes and regions that might be useful in combating breast cancer.</p><br><br>Read more at <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/breast-size-matters-but-not-in-the-way-you-think/%23gCQlpitsJXEiCC2R.99" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Breast Size Matters<i class="icon-external"></i></a></blockquote><br><br><br><br>资料来源是<a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/breast-size-matters-but-not-in-the-way-you-think/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Breast Size Matters<i class="icon-external"></i></a>
